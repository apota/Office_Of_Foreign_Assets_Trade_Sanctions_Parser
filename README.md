OFAC - is a wing of the US Dept. of Treasury that manages trade sanctions. The office periodically updates the list of identities (individuals, groups, countries etc) that the US organizations ARE NOT ALLOWED TO TRADE with.


This list very often contains identities defined in Arabic language.


The shell scripts do the following:

1. Scans the pusblished txt files of banned identities on the web 
2. Parses and tokenizes details to create a repository of identities
3. Delta processing is included, where only deltas are scanned to update the dictionary.
